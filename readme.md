#Exercise: Build a Car with an Engine

Get the code from GitHub, that Christian showed you yesterday.

You can download it in many ways, but the easiest (in the long run) is by cloning it.

    $ git clone https://github.com/dat17v1/20_OurClassAsType.git
Then you will have the code on your computer, and you can work with it.

##Create the program

1 . Create a program that asks the user to build a Car.

In the Console you should ask:

"What kind of brand should your car be of? :"
"What kind of model should your << the brand of your car >> be of?"    
"What size is your << the brand of your car >> ? "    
"What code is your << the brand of your car >> ? "    
"How many horsepowers does you << the brand of your car >> have? "    
Then you should print to the console the details of you new build car.

2 . Change your program into being able to ask you for 3 cars.
The cars should go into an array (or arraylist, if you preferre).

Print the all to the console.
